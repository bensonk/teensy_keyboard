h2. Teensy Keyboard Emulator

This is a barebones project that provides the tools to create custom teensy
programs that emulate a keyboard.  It makes it easy to provide strings that
will be "typed" into whatever computer the teensy is connected to.  It's 
a fairly minimal project at this point, but certainly works.
